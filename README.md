# FLR

## Description
FLR (From Left to Right) is a general purpose trading bot.

## READ BEFORE USE
1. If you don't enable `TEST_MODE`, you will be using REAL money.
2. To ensure you do not do this, ALWAYS check the `TEST_MODE` variable in `config.yml`.

## Usage

1. Install Dependencies
    - Easy mode (might clash with current deps)
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Preferred Method (venv)
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
      
        source .venv/bin/activate # linux
        .\.venv/scripts/activate # windows
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```


2. Copy `creds.example.yml` to `creds.yml` (or whatever you want.) and update the creds.

    ```sh
    # linux: Copy file over.
    cp creds.example.yml creds.yml

    # windows: either copy the file in explorer and rename to 'creds.yml' or use
    copy creds.example.yml creds.yml
    
    # powershell
    Copy-Item creds.example.yml -Destination creds.yml
    ```
    
    - Edit `creds.yml`.
    


3. Configure input params as in `config.yml`
     

4. Run the script
    - Standard 
        ```sh
        python3 flr.py
        ```
    - Background process (**linux only**)
        ```sh
        nohup python3 -u flr.py >> log.txt 2>&1 &
        ```
        The logs are stored in log.txt. To stop the process either look in your process list with `ps aux | grep -i python3` and kill with `kill PROCESS_ID` or `killall python3` when you know what you're doing.


5. Use the `--help` flag if you want to see supported arguments
